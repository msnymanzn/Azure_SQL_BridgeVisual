Power BI SQL Writeback Visual This repository contains the necessary files for a pre-built Power BI custom visual that enables real-time data writeback to a SQL database. This visual allows end-users to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and bulk data imports directly from a Power BI report.

Visual Overview The visual operates on a two-part architecture:
Read Operations (Direct Query): The visual retrieves data directly from your SQL database using a standard Power BI Direct Query connection.

Write Operations (Middleware): All write actions (insert, update, delete) are handled by a separate middleware server. This server, which you must have deployed and configured, acts as a secure proxy. This design ensures that sensitive database credentials are never stored within the Power BI report file itself.

Prerequisites To use this visual, you must have the following prepared:
Power BI Desktop: The application used to configure and view the report.

Deployed Middleware Server: A pre-existing middleware server that is configured to connect to your SQL database. You will need the URL of this server.

SQL Database Table: A SQL database with a table that contains the data you want to manage with the visual.

Firewall Configuration: The middleware and sql server server's firewall must be configured to allow it to connect to your database.

The .pbiviz File: The custom visual file provided in this package.

Installation and Configuration Follow these steps to set up the visual in your Power BI report:
Import the Visual: In Power BI Desktop, navigate to the Visualizations pane. Click the "..." button and select Import a visual from a file. Choose the SQL_BridgeVisual.1.0.0.0.pbiviz file.

Add Data: Drag the visual onto your report canvas. From the Fields pane, drag all the columns from your data model's table into the visual's Table Columns field well(note- first column should be your Primary Key).

Configure the Connection: With the visual selected, go to the Format pane (the paint roller icon). Find and expand the Database Configuration section. Fill in the following details:

Server: Your SQL Server instance name.

Database: The name of the database.

Username / Password: The credentials for the database account.

Middleware URL: The public URL of your deployed middleware server.

Schema / Table Name: The database schema and the exact name of the table for writeback.

Usage Guide Once configured, the visual will display your data in a dynamic table.
Insert a Record: Click the Insert button. Fill out the form that appears and click Submit.

Update a Record: Select a row by clicking on it, then click the Update button. A pre-filled form will appear for you to edit.

Delete a Record: Select a row, click the Delete button, and confirm the action.

Import Data (Bulk Insert): Click the Upload CSV button. Select a CSV file from your computer. The visual will show a preview before you confirm the import.

After any successful operation, the visual will automatically refresh your page to display the updated data.

Included Files SQL_BridgeVisual.1.0.0.0.pbiviz: The compiled Power BI custom visual file.
